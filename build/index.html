      <h1>3D Sculptures in Firefox</h1>
      <p>
        Introducing a new use for Firefox 3D view: Creating sculptures using DOM elements! For my first project using 3D view, I figured I'd take a skyscraper in
        <a href="http://hashrocket.com">Hashrocket</a>
        Chicago's neighborhood and attempt to recreate it using DOM elements and absolute positioning. The resulting building ended up being inspired by the design of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Center">John Hancock Center</a>, but is not a scale replica by any means.
      </p>
      <p>To view, make sure you're in Firefox and you have version 11 or later. Open the inspector (Cmd-Opt-i for Mac users), then enable 3D view by pressing the button in the bottom right or pressing Ctrl-w. Zoom in/out with the scroll wheel, and click-drag to rotate. You can also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/3D_view#Controlling_the_3D_view">keyboard shortcuts</a>, but you need a number pad to use the +/- zooming. You can also check out the source code on <a href="http://github.com/shaneriley/firefox_skyscraper">GitHub</a>.</p>
